			<h1>Joy M. Whitt</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in west Michigan, did a couple stints in Iowa and have settled into DC for the past 3 years. I love brunches, concerts, outdoor events, and otherwise enjoying everything that DC has to offer— especially if it brings people together! I love dance parties and I’m almost always looking for something fun to get into with my friends.</p>
	<p>I’m really passionate about civil service and you can usually find me volunteering at least once a week, or mentoring some truly awesome young kiddos.</p>
